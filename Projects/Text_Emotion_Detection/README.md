# **Text Emotion Detection**

Text-Based Emotion Detection is an AI-driven project that analyzes written text to identify and classify emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and more. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, the system interprets sentiment and emotional tone in messages, reviews, or conversations.

This technology can be applied in customer feedback analysis, mental health monitoring, chatbot interactions, and social media sentiment analysis, helping businesses and individuals gain deeper insights into human emotions through text. ðŸš€ðŸ’¡
