		"ML"
	The study of computer programs (algorithms) that can learn
	by example.
	E.g, speech recognition, email spam detection, self driving cars, image recognition

	Algorithms learn rules from labelled examples
	A set of labelled examples used for learning is called training data.

			KEY CONCEPTS IN ML


	Supervised Learning -> Labelled Data
		Classification -> discrete classes
		Regression -> Continuouse Values


	Unsupervised Learning -> Unlabelled Data
		Clustering -> similar instances in the data
		Outlier detection -> finding unsual patterns
