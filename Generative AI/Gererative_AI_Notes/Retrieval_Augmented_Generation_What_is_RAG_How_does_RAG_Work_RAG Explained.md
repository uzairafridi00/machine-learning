# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models: A Visual Guide 🧠🔍

## Understanding the Fine-Tuning Landscape 🌟

Fine-tuning transforms pre-trained LLMs into specialized tools for specific domains or tasks. The image shows the essential workflow:

1. 📊 **Start with a pre-trained model** - Leverage foundation models with broad knowledge
2. 🎯 **Apply domain-specific training** - Create a smaller, specialized model
3. 📈 **Measure performance** - Evaluate factuality and hallucination rates

## Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Process 🚀

Supervised fine-tuning adapts pre-trained language models to specific tasks using labeled data. This process transforms general-purpose models into specialized tools by optimizing their performance for specific applications.

### Key Steps in SFT Implementation ⚙️

| Step | Description | Details |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ Collect Data | Prepare high-quality labeled examples of desired outputs | A few hundred to few hundred thousand carefully curated examples |
| 2️⃣ Choose Method | Select full-parameter or parameter-efficient approach | LoRA/QLoRA or full parameter fine-tuning (FT) |
| 3️⃣ Train Model | Adjust model parameters to improve task performance | Keep base weights frozen or partially frozen |
| 4️⃣ Evaluate | Test against metrics like factuality and hallucination rate | Measure against held-out data, red-team for safety |

### SFT Techniques 🛠️

Several approaches can be employed during supervised fine-tuning:

- **Feature Extraction**: Using a pre-trained model to extract relevant features for task-specific models
- **End-to-End Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting every layer for comprehensive adaptation
- **Layer Freezing**: Locking certain layers to prevent updates during fine-tuning
- **Parameter-Efficient Adapters**: Methods like LoRA that add low-rank matrices to model layers

## How SFT Differs from Other Approaches 🔄
