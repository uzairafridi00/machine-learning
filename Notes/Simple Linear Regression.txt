	Simple Linear Regression

linear = Straight line in bidimentional plot


Two Continuous Variables i.e x and y axis
and we used it to identify the other values

	one is dependent and the other one is independent

	Relationship between two variables (Statistically significant relationship)
	On relationship base we do prediction

EQUATION:
	y = a + bx

	a = constant / intercept
	b = function / slope of x

OR:
	Linear Regression Model

y =  β0 + β1x + ε

	y = dependent variable
	x = independent variable
	β0 = is the constant or intercept
	β1 = is x's slope or coefficient
	ε = is the error term


____________________________________________
	
	Two Variables involved

1. Dependent variable = y
		        var whose value we want to forecast	

2. Independent variable = x
			  var that explains the other one


	Example => Salary vs Experience Relationship (Train Set)

	Linear Regression

Simple LR -> 1 input and 1 output
Multiple LR -> more than 1 input and 1 output
Polynomial LR -> when your data is not linear then this will be used
