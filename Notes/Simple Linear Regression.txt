	Simple Linear Regression

linear = Straight line in bidimentional plot


Two Continuous Variables i.e x and y axis
and we used it to identify the other values

	one is dependent and the other one is independent

	Relationship between two variables
	On relationship base we do prediction

EQUATION:
	y = a + bx

	a = constant / intercept
	b = function / slope of x
