			Artificial Intelligence 

refers to computer systems that are capable of performing task that typically requires human 			   		   intelligence. Such as decision making, NLP, CV etc. Example of Petrol prices increases with dollars. 			           AI system can learn from data and improve overtime like humans. ML and Deep Learning are subset of AI.
Reasoning, AI use logic and inference rules to solve problems.

	Types of AI 

Narrow AI => Focused on Single Task
General AI => General Intelligence and capabilities

		AI vs Data Science vs ML vs DL


AI includes ML, DL and Big Data
Data Science is 50% to 70% merges into AI

Data Analytics is part of data science --> in which we capture Data Driven Decision


		STEPS

1) Data Basic Analysis
2) Then apply ML and DL on data
3) Then we move to AI


Software Development, App Development comes under AI

		Data Science vs Data Analytics

data science involves using data to build models that can predict future outcomes, --- while data analytics tends to focus on analyzing past data to inform decisions in the present --

Data Science works on Data Sets, Training ML models, Data mining, Data cleaning, Deploying AI applications etc -- Data Analytics; querying data, interpret the data, and visualize the data in a meaning-full way for better decision making

		History of AI

1943 -> Warren & Walter proposed simplified model of brain neurons
1950 -> Alan Turing Test - measure the machine intelligence
1955 -> John - Coined the term AI also developed Lisp Programming language
1997 -> IBM Deep Blue - Chess game beat human
2011 -> IBM Watson - Defeated human champions
2012 -> Deep Neural Network introduced
2024 -> now AI transforms vision, speech, robotics and more
