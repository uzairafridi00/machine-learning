	Data Driven Decision Making = ML

ML allows machine to learn and make decisions smartly
Data - Learning - Prediction - Decisions

	Training = Data Driven
	Prediction = Decision Making



Data Driven = Data -> Training -> Model
Then this model will help you to make decisions

ML is important to predict hidden insights of data
Without data its not possible.

	ML TYPES

Supervised / Classification = Label data 
				Input Data 80% 
				Training model and Patterns of data 20%
				Prediction
				Output and reports
	
		Classification - Categories
		Regression - Numerical Data 

		ALGOS
	
	Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
	Logistic Regression			
	KNN
	SVM
	Kernel SVM
	Naive Bayes
	Decision Tree Classifier
	Random Forest Classification


_____________________________________________


UnSupervised / Clustering = Self learn / not label data
				No Supervision

				Training Model and Learning Patterns of data (Clustering)
				Prediction
				Output and reports								


		ALGO

	K-Means Clustering
	Hierarichal Clustering
	Probabilistic Clustering


_____________________________________________

Semisupervised = Mixture of Supervised and Unsupervised
		Some Labelled data and Unlabelled data
		
	When you get which has more missing values and you can't delete all the data
	


_____________________________________________



Reinforcement = Learn from mistakes and depends on feedback
		
		Input Data
		Training Model and Learning patterns of data

	Prediction based on reward and punishment
	Hit and Trial learning
	
	Example => Google Mail Spam -> google asking you that mail is Spam or not


		ALOGS

	Model Free Reinforcement Learning
		Policy Optimizatio
		Q-Learning

	Model Based Reinforcement Learning
		Learn the model
		Given the model
