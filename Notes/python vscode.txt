			MINICONDA
		CONDA ENVIRONMENTS / Containers


We need to create different environments for different tasks like EDA, ML, DL

Example: Car tools in Car tool box. Gardening tools in Gardening tool box

E.g: Home with different rooms i.e living room, bedroom, kitchen etc. In each room we have specific tools according to the room.

	
		Why we need different Envrironments
We need to put the tools of kitchen in kitechen not in bedroom and living room otherwise there will be conflicts.
Same with python libraries for specific tasks like EDA, ML and DL.

Enironment is like room which contains different tools/libraries.
We keep specific version of tools in each environment so that there should no conflicts in tools.





	Create your environment for Streamlit

	conda env list

	conda create -n streamlit_env
	
	conda init

	conda activate streamlit_env

	conda deactivate
	
	conda list
	
	conda env remove --name streamlit_env       ==> need to be in base when removing
