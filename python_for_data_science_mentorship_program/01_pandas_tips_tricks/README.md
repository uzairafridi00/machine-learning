# Pandas & Exploratory Data Analysis

All the pandas tips and tricks for doing exploratory data analysis are collected in this section. 

## Intro to Pandas
1. A high-level data manipulation tool built on the Numpy package.
2. Designed to make data cleaning and analysis quick and easy in Python.

## Rows and Columns
Rows - rows set the data from left to right in horizontal form, and the other names for rows are records, instances, datapoints, observations.

Columns - Columns align the data from top to bottom, and the other names for columns are attributes, variables, fields , dimensions

## Data Cleaning ðŸ§¹
1. Handling Missing Data: Utilize methods like `dropna()`, `fillna()`, and understand the importance of `inplace` parameter.
2. Data Type Conversion: Grasp `astype()` to convert data types and understand pandasâ€™ native data types.
3. Removing Duplicates: Employ `drop_duplicates()` to maintain data integrity.

## Data Manipulation & Analysis ðŸ“ˆ
1. Aggregation: Use powerful grouping and aggregation tools like `groupby()`, `pivot_table()`, and `crosstab()`.
2. String Operations: Dive into the .str accessor for essential string operations within Series.
3. Merging, Joining, and Concatenating: Understand the differences and applications of `merge()`, `join()`, and `concat()`.
4. Reshaping Data: Grasp `melt()` and `pivot()` for transforming datasets.
