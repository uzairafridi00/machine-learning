    "# **Boosting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting ensemble is a type of ensemble learning (Supervised Machine Learning) that involves training multiple models in sequence, where each model is trained to correct the errors of the previous models, and the final prediction is a weighted combination of the predictions of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting ensemble can reduce the bias of the final prediction, and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to prioritize samples that were incorrectly categorized in previous iterations, allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boosting approach is designed to produce a strong learner that is accurate on the training data and can generalize effectively to new data."

    "## How Does Boosting Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Firstly, a model is built from the training data.\n",
    "2. Then the second model is built which tries to correct the data errors present in the first model.\n",
    "3. This procedure is continued and models are added until either the complete training data set is predicted correctly or the maximum number of models is added.\n",

    "## **Can Ensemble Methods Compete with Neural Networks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Structured Data`: For many tasks involving structured data (e.g., tabular data), ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting often outperform neural networks due to their ability to handle categorical features and missing values effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Small to Medium-sized Datasets`: Ensemble methods can be more effective when the dataset size is small to medium. Neural networks may overfit or underperform due to insufficient data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Unstructured Data`: For tasks involving unstructured data (e.g., images, text), neural networks, particularly deep learning models, are typically more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble learning methods (bagging and boosting) are powerful and can sometimes outperform neural networks, especially on structured data and smaller datasets. However, for tasks requiring the extraction of complex patterns from large amounts of unstructured data, neural networks are usually more suitable."
