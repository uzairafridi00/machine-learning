# Zero to Mathematics

Mathematics is a formal science that deals with abstract concepts of number, quantity, structure, space, change, and relations, utilizing a system of logical reasoning and rigorous proof to explore and explain the concepts.

- **Counting Numbers**
  - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
- **Measurement**
  - Unit or Scale
  - E.g. 1 10 100 1000 1M 1B
  - E.g. Temperature 17 Degree Celsius
  - E.g. Weight 200g or 1Kg
- **Quantity**
  - Count
  - E.g. I have 1000 rupees so how many Rs 10 notes you have.
- **Logical Reasoning**
  - E.g. Elder and Younger brothers. There is age difference between them.
- **Rigorous Proof**
  - We need to have facts, figures and opinions to prove something.

## Zero Theory

It is a simple theory that if zero represents something then how can it be nothing. This theory, for now, only had has one answer, which is that mathmatitians had to use something to represent something which was a hole with nothing inside. Another conclusion is that zero is actually everything, because if there is only nothing, then nothing must be everything.

Mathematically, a concept of zero plays an important role in our theories of natural, integer, and real numbers. For instance, when considering an algebraic structure (e.g., a group) under addition, zero often serves as the identity element (since for any number n, n + 0 = n ).

## Factor and Multiples in Maths

### Factors

Factors are the numbers that can exactly divide another number without leaving a remainder. **Example:** The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 because they can divide 12 exactly.

### Multiples

Mutiples are what you get when you multiply a number by a integer by the integers. **Example:** The first five multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.

## Divisibility Rules in Maths

4242628 if divided by 2 we will get remainder or not.

1. **Rule of 2:**
   1. Last even number then it is divided by 2.
2. **Rule of 3:**
   1. If the sum of its digit is divisible by 3 then it is divisible.
   2. For number 123, the sum of its digits is 1+2+3=6. Since 6 is divisible by 3, so is 123.
   3. 125312131518910153 -> 52/3 -> 5+2 -> 7/3. So this big number is not divisible by 3, because remainder will be 1.
3. **Rule of 4:**
   1. A number is divible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.
   2. The number 732 is divisible by 4 because the number formed by the last two digits is 32, which is divisible by 4.
4. **Rule of 5:**
   1. If the last digit is divisible by 5.
   2. If the last digit is 0.
5. **Rule of 6:**
   1. If Rule of 2 and Rule of 3 completes.
6. **Rule of 9:**
   1. If the sum of its digit is divisible by 3 then it is divisible.
   2. 9819 = 9+8+1+9 = 27/9
7. **Rule of 10:**
   1. If the last digit is divisible by 0.

## GCD & LCM in Maths

Greatest Common Divisor & Least Common Multiple

_Example:_ The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.

## Modular Aritmetic

Modular Arithmetic, often termed as the arithmetic clock. It's a system wherein numbers wrap around upon reaching a certain value known as the modulus.

### Modulus
