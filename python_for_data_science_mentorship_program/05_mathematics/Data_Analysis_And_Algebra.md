# Data Analysis Basics in Algebra

## Understanding Data

- **Collecting Data**
  - Data collection is the process of gathering information from various sources to be used for analysis.

- **Organizing Data**
  - Data organization involves structuring collected information into a format that is easy to understand and analyze, such as tables, charts, or graphs.

## Descriptive Statistics

- **Mean, Median, Mode**
  - The mean is the average of a set of numbers, the median is the middle value when the numbers are in order, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value.

- **Range**
  - The range of a data set is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the set.

- **Interquartile Range**
  - The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of variability that describes the middle 50% of values when ordered from lowest to highest.

## Probability

- **Simple Probability**
  - Simple probability measures the likelihood of a single event occurring, calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

- **Compound Events**
  - Compound events involve the probability of two or more events happening at the same time, and can be independent or dependent on each other.

## Pre-Algebra Problem Solving

### Strategies for Problem Solving

- **Understanding the Problem**
  - Understanding the problem involves identifying what is being asked, determining the relevant information, and recognizing the unknowns.
- **Devising a Plan**
  - Devising a plan includes coming up with a method or strategy to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating a table, or breaking down the problem into smaller parts.
- **Carrying Out the Plan**
  - Executing the plan involves applying the chosen strategy and carrying out the necessary steps to arrive at a solution.
- **Reviewing/Extending the Solution**
  - Reviewing the solution entails checking the results for accuracy and determining if the solution can be applied to other problems or extended in some way.

### Strategies for Problem Solving: A Concrete Example

- Example Problem
  - Shamsa is planning a birthday party. She has a budget of $150 and wants to buy party favors that cost $5 each. How many party favors can she buy?
- Understanding the Problem
  - Shamsa needs to calculate the maximum number of party favors she can buy without exceeding her budget.
- Devising a Plan
  - She will divide the total budget by the cost of one party favor to find out the maximum number she can purchase.
- Carrying Out the Plan
  - Shamsa carries out the calculation: $150 divided by $5 per party favor equals 30 party favors.
- Reviewing/Extending the Solution
  - She reviews her calculation to ensure she hasnâ€™t exceeded the budget and considers if there are any discounts for buying in bulk that could allow her to purchase more favors or save money.
