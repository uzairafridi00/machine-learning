# 🚀 FastAPI for Machine Learning: End-to-End Course

Welcome to the official repository for the **FastAPI for Machine Learning** course! This comprehensive 20–22 hour course walks you through building powerful, production-ready APIs using **FastAPI**, with a special focus on deploying **Machine Learning** models. You’ll learn from API basics to deployment using modern DevOps practices.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is designed to help **data scientists**, **backend developers**, and **AI engineers** build real-world ML-powered APIs using **FastAPI** and deploy them efficiently. We go beyond the basics by incorporating **Redis**, **Docker**, **JWT**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Render**.
